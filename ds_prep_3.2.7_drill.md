# Drill - Evaluating data sources

* Amsterdam availability data scraped from Airbnb on December 24th. Question: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?

   __Answer__: The problem here is that the question seems to be about popular Amsterdam neighborhoods in general while sampling said neighborhoods right before a holiday (Christmas). This may impact the data. I would reframe the question to ask "What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam around Christmas time?"


* Mental health services use on September 12, 2001, in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. Question: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

   __Answer__: Again, this is another case where a general question is being asked, and the data set may be significantly impacted by a major event--in this case, the 9/11 terror attack in New York City. And again my response would be to ask a reframed question: "How did the pattern of mental health service vary between two cities--one in the aftermath of a direct terrorist attack, and the other not directly affected by a terrorist attack?"


* Question: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs (source: [Armenian Pub Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/erikhambardzumyan/pubs))?

   __Answer__: The occupation of the respondents are almost all "Students" or "Students + working" (70% and 23%). I would reframe the question to ask "what are the most common reasons Armenian _students_ visit local pubs?"
